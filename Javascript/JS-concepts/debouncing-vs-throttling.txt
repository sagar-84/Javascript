// Debouncing and Throttling are generally used for performance optimization or rate limiting of function call/function execution.
// Debouncing - If the difference between 2 keystroke events is >= certain time (Ex - 300ms), then only make function call.
// Throttling - If the difference between last function call and current function call is certain time (Ex - 300ms), then only make function call.
// (Calling an API after certain interval of time)

// Example 1 : search function in e-commerce applications. (Debouncing makes more sense for this example)

// Example 2 : window resize (Both makes sense for this example. It depends on use case)

// Example 3 : On button click - shooting game (Throttling makes more sense)
// Suppose if we have to develop a shooting game where user can shoot enemies or any element on the website, both can be a good way to limit that
// number of clicks (or maybe freeze the gun)
// Incase of a machine gun - Throttling
// Incase of a Pistol - Debounce
