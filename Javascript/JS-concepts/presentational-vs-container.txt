What are container components? -
Container components are primarily concerned with how things work
they are often stateful
they are responsible for providing data and behavior to their children (usually presentational components)

class ImageContainer extends React.Component {
   constructor() {
      super();
      
      this.state = {
         images: []
      };
   }
   componentDidMount() {
      fetch('/api/current_user/image_list')
         .then(response => response.json())
         .then(images => this.setState({images}));
   }
   render() {
      return (
         <div className="image-list">
            {this.state.images.map(image => {
               <Image image={image}/>
            })}
         </div>
      )
   }
}
export default ImageContainer

what are presentational components? -
Presentational Components are primarily concerned with how things look
probably only contain a render method and little else logic

const Image = props => (
   <img src={props.image} />
)
export default Image
